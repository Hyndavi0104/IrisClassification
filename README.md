# üå∏ Iris Flower Classification Project  
**Internship Project ‚Äì Unified Mentor**

---

## üß© Problem Statement

The iris flower, scientifically known as *Iris*, is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. Within this genus, there are three primary species: **Iris Setosa**, **Iris Versicolor**, and **Iris Virginica**. These species exhibit variations in their physical characteristics, particularly in the measurements of **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

---

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species. The model's primary goal is to **automate the classification process** based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.

## üß† Project Summary

### Description
The Iris Flower Classification project develops a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Each species exhibits unique characteristics, making it suitable for supervised learning classification.

### Key Details
- Dataset features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.  
- Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.  
- Model training: Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested.  
- The trained model classifies flowers into the correct species based on input features.

## üìä Results

**Primary Evaluation Metric:** Recall  

After removing overfitted models (train metrics = 100%), the final results are:

| Sl. No. | Classification Model       | Recall Train (%) | Recall Test (%) |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1       | Decision Tree (tuned)     | 95.24          | 95.56          |
| 2       | Random Forest (tuned)     | **97.14**      | **97.78**      |
| 3       | Naive Bayes               | 94.28          | 97.78          |
| 4       | Naive Bayes (tuned)       | 94.28          | 97.78          |

‚úÖ The **tuned Random Forest model** showed the best performance.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The **tuned Random Forest model** was selected as the final prediction model for classifying Iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*.

### Key Insights
- **Data Exploration:** *Iris Setosa* features are clearly separable from the other two species.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values handled; categorical features encoded.  
- **Model Selection:** Tuned Random Forest chosen for accuracy and interpretability.  
- **Evaluation:** Model showed excellent recall and accuracy.

### Challenges & Future Work
- Feature engineering and model tuning were challenging.  
- Future enhancements: ensemble learning, deep learning, or cross-validation optimization.

### Practical Application
- Can be used in **botanical studies**, **horticulture**, and **environmental monitoring**.  
- Automates species identification based on flower measurements.
